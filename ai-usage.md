now in the Hero section, I wanted to do AnimatedText components. I was changing the text each 5 seconds, I noticed it it disrupting the user experience so I asked ChatGPT and it recommended to me changing the text less frequently so the user have a chance to read it and to less make noise for the user. Also it recommended that making subtitles. For example the main title is web developer and one of the subtitles could be UI/UX Lover so it makes less noise. By the way I, what I was doing is I was changing the main title and I didn't have subtitles.
